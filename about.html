            <h1>Knitting Materials</h1>
            <p>In this Part we deal with how we can make clothes like skirts, 
                 caps,bags including school bags,laptop bags & women bags,... this helps us 
                 to not sit with out work and intsead of going for  other things which are not important 
                 we sit down and do that it also helps us to earn money and we can also buy for our selves 
                 any thing we want like airtime,under wears,... and increases and  expands our brain capacity of thinking new things
and creativity even this is supported by the bible where we find that in the prophetic classes they learnt to do different 
things with there hands even Jesus was a carpenter and Dorcas who was famous she used 
 to knit cloths and also us as Ambassadors we shall not sit with out work.
